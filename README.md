# Example-Game-CICD-for-Godot-4
An example project with a sample set of cicd scripts which can be used for godot games

This will be used to reproduce a bug in --export and --headless and provide a usable demonstration of the issue.

Internally we use our own engine but we use godotengine/godot binaries to demonstrate the bug.
